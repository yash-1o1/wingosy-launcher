# Argosy → Wingosy parity tracker

This file is the durable source of truth for the daily Argosy parity review.
It lives outside either repository so it is not published as application code.

## Objective

Audit Argosy's `origin/main` history from its first commit to its latest commit in
strict chronological order. Record every commit reviewed. Implement one or two
portable, worthwhile Argosy features in Wingosy per daily run until the audit and
portable-feature backlog are complete. After parity, inspect new Argosy commits
from the previous 24 hours; only when there are no relevant new commits should the
job make a small independent Wingosy improvement.

Parity means feature parity where it makes sense for Wingosy's Windows/Tauri
architecture. It does not mean copying Android-only implementation details,
branding, release metadata, obsolete intermediate fixes, or code verbatim.

## Repositories and baseline

- Argosy: `C:\Users\yash6\repos\argosy-launcher`
- Wingosy: `C:\Users\yash6\repos\wingosy-launcher`
- Argosy first commit: `900808dc5c938f0e42b779b4c1240a41d8bc4414` — Initial commit: Argosy Launcher
- Argosy baseline observed: `a1e8437463c95b4a34bc9b8a6f6005ad5cf0c7c4` — 2026-09-20
- Baseline history size: 2,842 commits
- Wingosy baseline observed: `612c0991d66a21ed157e00c84071a7d9e41379eb` — 2026-09-21
- Audit direction: oldest → newest, first-parent-independent chronological order from `git log --reverse origin/main`

### Local verification constraints

Recorded 2026-09-21 so future runs do not rediscover them:

- `git`, `node`, `npm` and `gh` are not on `PATH`. Working binaries:
  git `C:\Users\yash6\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\native\git\cmd\git.exe`,
  node `C:\Users\yash6\AppData\Local\OpenAI\Codex\bin\5b9024f90663758b\node.exe`,
  gh `C:\Users\yash6\Documents\Codex\2026-06-04\do-you-have-access-to-my\work\tools\gh\bin\gh.exe`.
  Run frontend checks directly, e.g. `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run`.
- **Rust cannot be compiled locally.** Smart App Control is enforced
  (`HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Policy\VerifiedAndReputablePolicyState = 1`),
  so Windows blocks every unsigned build-script executable cargo produces in
  `target/` with `os error 4551`. VS Build Tools 2022 (MSVC 14.44 + Windows SDK
  10.0.26100) was installed on 2026-09-21 and did **not** lift this; the linker
  now exists but cargo still cannot execute what it builds. Disabling Smart App
  Control is irreversible without reinstalling Windows and must not be done
  without the user's explicit decision.
- Consequence: Rust changes are verified by CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  `cargo test` and clippy on `windows-latest` for every push to `main`). A run
  that touches Rust must say so and check the CI result.

## Status vocabulary

- `implemented`: portable behavior added to Wingosy and pushed.
- `already-covered`: equivalent behavior already exists in Wingosy.
- `candidate`: portable behavior worth implementing later.
- `not-portable`: Android-specific or incompatible with Wingosy's architecture.
- `superseded`: an intermediate change replaced by a later Argosy commit.
- `non-feature`: docs, release/version metadata, funding, formatting, or repository administration.
- `decision-needed`: a product choice is recorded under Open decisions; safe unrelated work may continue.

## Audit cursor

- Last fully audited Argosy commit: `a98a571e8ae977de28df75b212b3560df93f5240`
- Next Argosy commit: `0e4296dbc91970d9d41f69bdd4b6540bfef32699`
- Audited: 15 / 2,842 baseline commits
- Portable candidates waiting: 0
- Last tracker update: 2026-09-21

The first automated parity run must begin with `900808d`. A run may inspect as
many consecutive commits as needed to locate one or two coherent features, but
must record every inspected commit before advancing this cursor.

## Chronological audit ledger

| Seq. | Argosy commit | Date | Summary | Status | Wingosy mapping / notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `900808d` | 2025-12-06 | Initial commit: Argosy Launcher | already-covered | Wingosy already provides the portable launcher foundation: setup, RomM library sync, downloads, emulator detection/launch, library/search, and settings. Android framework and bundled design-doc mechanics are not copied. |
| 2 | `2581867` | 2025-12-06 | Update app icon to nautical helm and refine UI | already-covered | Wingosy has its own branding, setup folder picker, download-count badge, and download/sync surfaces. Android SAF and Argosy branding are platform-specific. |
| 3 | `a2fadf7` | 2025-12-06 | Add release compliance: signing, icons, privacy policy | non-feature | Android/Play Store signing, launcher resources, and compliance documentation; no portable runtime behavior. |
| 4 | `c0727f9` | 2025-12-06 | Add README with project overview and features | non-feature | Documentation-only change. |
| 5 | `ae856c5` | 2025-12-06 | Refactor input legend with consistent hierarchy | already-covered | Wingosy immersive views use a shared hint bar and consistent controller hierarchy. |
| 6 | `92ad408` | 2025-12-06 | Refactor business logic into Use Cases with unit tests | non-feature | Android architecture/test refactor with no user-visible behavior to port. |
| 7 | `ad8519e` | 2025-12-06 | Add user ratings with offline sync queue | implemented | Wingosy now exposes its existing local status, 1–5 personal rating, and 1–5 difficulty persistence in both desktop and immersive game details (`ba600c0`). RomM write/offline-queue behavior remains an explicit product decision below. |
| 8 | `b7a5b79` | 2025-12-06 | Fix RomM API request body format for user props | decision-needed | Applies only if Wingosy adopts RomM-backed user-property writes; the local-only implementation does not issue this request. |
| 9 | `0e23a85` | 2025-12-06 | Add GitHub CI workflows and project templates | non-feature | Repository administration: CI, issue/PR templates, Dependabot, EditorConfig, README badges. Wingosy already has its own CI, nightly, beta and release workflows. |
| 10 | `50f0099` | 2025-12-06 | Add Ko-fi username for funding support | non-feature | `.github/FUNDING.yml` only; no runtime behavior. |
| 11 | `3f1fc99` | 2025-12-06 | Suppress false positive RestrictedApi lint warning | not-portable | Android lint annotation on `dispatchKeyEvent`; no Tauri/Windows equivalent. |
| 12 | `32b72cc` | 2025-12-06 | Add debug build differentiation and fix ProGuard rules | not-portable | Android debug theming, launcher icon variants and Moshi/Retrofit ProGuard keep rules. Wingosy has no R8/ProGuard stage. |
| 13 | `4047889` | 2025-12-07 | Add self-updater with GitHub Releases integration | already-covered | Wingosy's updater is broader: `tauri-plugin-updater` with signed `latest.json`, a pubkey, `createUpdaterArtifacts`, passive install, plus `UpdaterConfig` with `check_on_startup`, `auto_update_enabled` and a Stable/Beta/Nightly channel. WorkManager periodic scheduling is Android-only. |
| 14 | `3b4cea6` | 2025-12-07 | Add update download and install functionality | already-covered | APK download plus system package-installer intent; Tauri's passive installer flow replaces it end to end. |
| 15 | `a98a571` | 2025-12-07 | Add community rating display and UI refinements | implemented | `612c099`. Added RomM `average_rating` as a fallback behind IGDB `aggregated_rating`/`total_rating`, a shared `formatCommunityRating` helper, the missing community rating row in immersive game details, and an accurate "Community rating" label on desktop. Compose typography/opacity tweaks are Argosy-specific styling and were not ported. |

## Implemented parity outside the chronological audit

These features were implemented before this ledger existed. They are useful
cross-references, but they do not advance the chronological cursor; the matching
Argosy commits must still be recorded when encountered.

| Wingosy commit | Capability |
|---|---|
| `57bc35f` / merge `2505564` | Per-platform RomM library sync monitor with progress and controller-accessible navigation. |
| `fe9b0f4` / merge `1174c52` | RomM-backed RetroAchievements definitions, progress, badge art, refresh, and hardcore status. |
| `b93b365` | Achievement completion bars, earned/total points, empty states, accessibility, and stale-request protection. |
| `c0289bb` | Case-insensitive normalization of local RomM hostnames. |

## Open decisions

### RomM sync for personal ratings and difficulty

- Argosy commits: `ad8519e`, `b7a5b79`.
- Question: should Wingosy sync personal rating/difficulty to RomM with a durable offline queue, or keep these fields local to each PC?
- Trade-offs: RomM sync makes the data portable across devices but adds API-version compatibility, conflict, retry, and stale-write semantics; local-only storage is predictable and already works offline but does not roam.
- Recommendation: keep the newly exposed fields local until the current RomM user-properties contract and conflict semantics are covered by integration tests, then add opt-in sync as a separate vertical slice.
- Provisional choice: local-only, explicitly labeled in the editor. The chronological audit can continue while this remains unresolved.
- Opened: 2026-09-17. Resolution: pending user decision.

When a decision is needed, append an item containing:

1. the Argosy commit(s) involved;
2. the question and relevant trade-offs;
3. the automation's recommended default;
4. what work can safely continue while awaiting the answer; and
5. the date and resolution once the user replies.

The daily run should also repeat unresolved questions in its final report. It
must not block the entire parity audit when a wise reversible default or unrelated
chronological work can proceed safely.

## Daily run log

| Date | Argosy range audited | Features implemented | Wingosy commit | Verification | Notes / questions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-16 | Pre-tracker improvement | Local RomM hostname normalization | `c0289bb` | 37 unit tests, typecheck, lint, build | Original generic-improvement run; does not advance parity cursor. |
| 2026-09-17 | `900808d..b7a5b79` (8 commits) | Local per-game status, rating, and difficulty editor in desktop and immersive views | `ba600c0` | 39 unit tests, typecheck, lint (0 errors; 8 existing warnings), build | Pushed to `origin/main`. RomM user-property syncing remains an open product decision; provisional behavior is local-only. |
| 2026-09-21 | `0e23a85..a98a571` (7 commits) | Community rating: RomM `average_rating` fallback, shared formatter, immersive display, accurate desktop label | `612c099` | 43 unit tests (+4 new), typecheck, lint (0 errors; 8 existing warnings), build. Rust verified in CI, not locally (Smart App Control blocks cargo, `os error 4551`): CI run `35642876461` green, including "Cargo tests (non-ignored)" and "Rust lint". | Pushed to `origin/main` after the user chose CI verification for the Rust half. First run in this program to touch Rust. Argosy baseline grew 2,741 → 2,842 (tip `a1e8437`, 2026-09-20). |

## Completion rule

Historical parity is reached only when:

- every Argosy commit through the stored baseline has a ledger disposition;
- every portable candidate is either implemented, already covered, superseded,
  or resolved as an explicit product decision; and
- the audit cursor is at the latest fetched Argosy `origin/main` commit.

After that point, each daily run fetches Argosy and reviews commits from the last
24 hours. If relevant commits exist, it handles those first. If none exist, it may
make one small, safe Wingosy improvement under the existing verification and
direct-push rules.
